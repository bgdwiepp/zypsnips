[question about value of Rext]
07:40 < jpa-> AFAIK Rext is a ghost that lingers around any crystal oscillator confusing people, but 
              is only summoned in special situations such as testing the robustness of the oscillator 
              against crystal variations
07:50 < dongs> you mean series xtal resistor?
07:50 < dongs> fuck that shit, just adds cost to bom
07:50 < dongs> just like 1M parallel shit
07:50 < dongs> remove for great justice

[On calculating C1/C2 from Cl values]
16:14 < zyp> rule of thumb, C1 and C2 should be 2*Cl minus some for the stray capacitance
