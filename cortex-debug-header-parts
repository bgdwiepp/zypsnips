esden's choice: FTSH-105-01-L-DV-K   (SMT)
not super cheap, (he gets from samtec directly) but it has partial 
shrouding, only around the pins where the key on the cable goes, so it
takes up a lot less space.  Looks sorta like this:

Karl's choice: 
1175-1629-ND (smt)
1175-1627-ND (pth)
Much much much cheaper, but fully fully shrouded, so more board space.
Also, he's never actually used them yet ;)
