So, you've got ripple on your smps?  And you're scoping it how?
(Oh, you do know about capacitor derating on dc bias right?)

Let our resident definitely not a russian advise you....

01:38 < R2COM> what caps on in and out and what inductor?
01:38 < R2COM> what is part # for that cap?
01:39 < R2COM> whats its DC rating?
01:41 < R2COM> @ 5V for that specific cap, you have according to datasheet characteristics -60% 
               Capacitance
01:41 < R2COM> thats first big fault
01:41 < R2COM> another thing is
01:41 < R2COM> how do you actually MEASURE it?
01:41 < R2COM> how do you connect scope probe to it?
01:41 < R2COM> i mean
01:41 < R2COM> in what mode scope input is configured?
01:42 < dongs> just normal capture. and i tried both long gnd lead and short test clip, its ~same
01:42 < R2COM> DC or AC input?
01:42 < dongs> should be dc
01:42 < R2COM> wrong
01:42 < R2COM> must use AC input
01:42 < R2COM> did you also BW limited the channel?
01:43 < dongs> no and no
01:43 < R2COM> so: wrong measurement
01:44 < R2COM> configure scope to AC input, BW to 20MHz limit, then turn off your circuit, connect 
               probe to where you measuring it, and select number of averages so that you see <<1mV 
               ripple
01:44 < R2COM> then turn on circuit
01:44 < R2COM> that would be proper measurement
