PHYs:
qyx: ksz8031rnl (Micrel) (small, cheap, nice)
    (This is EOL, micrel reccommends KSZ8081RNx replacement)
    (8091 is the same, with WakeOnLan and energy saving ethernet stuff)
qyx also approves of 8051, fwiw.
zyp: ksz8081rnaca

dongs: DP83848 (TI, ex natsemi)

Other people have used the SMSC LAN8720A, but...
03:11 < zyp> shame the phy doesn't have cable test functions
03:11 < emeb> yeah, it's got a loopback, but that's all
03:11 < zyp> the micrel phy got some fancy reflectometry function for testing the cable
03:12 < emeb> nice
03:12 < emeb> and it's got a lower BOM - fewer passives IIRC

MACs:
