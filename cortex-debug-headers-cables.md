Assuming you want to use ARM's "standard" cortex debug, that's 2x10, 1.27mm pitch
Common older style is 2x10, 2.54mm pitch.

## Cables

[Olimex 2.54mm->1.27mm adapter](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/)

[Cable only](http://microcontrollershop.com/product_info.php?products_id=4517)


## Board headers

### esden's choice: FTSH-105-01-L-DV-K   (SMT)
not super cheap, (he gets from samtec directly) but it has partial 
shrouding, only around the pins where the key on the cable goes, so it
takes up a lot less space.  [Looks sorta like this]

### Karl's choice:
* 1175-1629-ND (smt)
* 1175-1627-ND (pth)

Much much much cheaper, but fully fully shrouded, so more board space.
Also, he's never actually used them yet ;)
