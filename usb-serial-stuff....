Have always believed cp210x to be perfectly good awesome cheap alternatives to
ftdi parts.... felipebalbi has some other opinions...



22:53 < felipebalbi> CareBear\: they could be using pl2303
22:53 < CareBear\> yes, I know
22:53 < felipebalbi> brrrr, that gives me the creeps
22:54 < felipebalbi> or even worse, cp210x
22:54 < CareBear\> cp210x are nice
22:54 < felipebalbi> guess I'll have nightmares
22:54 < felipebalbi> they're not... Try a loop of open(),
write_something_large() close()
22:54 < felipebalbi> it'll fail in 20 or so iterations
22:54 < felipebalbi> and that's a bug within the device
22:55 < felipebalbi> we managed to reproduce on windows and linux
22:55 < felipebalbi> heh
22:55 < CareBear\> well done!
22:55 < CareBear\> any response?
22:55 < felipebalbi> CareBear\: if you open(); loop { write_something_large()
}; close() -> no 
                     issues
22:55 < felipebalbi> CareBear\: of course not :-p  no responses
22:55 < felipebalbi> CareBear\: had to just call it quits, device can't take it
22:55 < felipebalbi> move on
