01:04 < kakimir> I think I did once..
01:04 < upgrdman> i cried after i realized my passion (3d shitz... so "art" in general) wouldn't pay 
                  for shit unless i was a lucky 1%. so i said fuck it and start to fuck with 
                  software and electronics

04:13 < upgrdman> anyone know if theres an eclipse or visual studio plugin for checking MISRA C compliance?
04:23 < dongs> not free, no
