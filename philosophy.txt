01:04 < kakimir> did you cry after trying to make indie game?
01:04 < upgrdman> no
01:04 < kakimir> I think I did once..
01:04 < upgrdman> i cried after i realized my passion (3d shitz... so "art" in general) wouldn't pay 
                  for shit unless i was a lucky 1%. so i said fuck it and start to fuck with 
                  software and electronics
