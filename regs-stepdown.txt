This comes up a bit, but I haven't captured all the favourites here yet...
I'll try and keep updating this with winners over time...

we're normally talking "somewhat large" vin, "somewhat reasonable" current rating.
People normally want "cheap" and "as few as possible external components"
and "small inductorz plz"

(4.5-18V input)
12:00 < dongs> http://www.ti.com/product/tps54627 is awesome according to my twpal
12:00 < dongs> he uses it for everything
12:00 < dongs> they're .25c/ea in a reel for him,, china has them for about .80
12:00 < dongs> tiny inductor and very low ripple
12:00 < dongs> yes 6A but it works for everything even when you dont need 6A

http://www.ti.com/product/tps54232/description should be even cooler, 3-28V input, 2A.


RT8293B is super cheap
MP2403 (pin compat with richtek)

scrts: MP28128, (2.7-6Vin, 2.5A output, 1.5Mhz)

qyx suggested L5973D, http://www.st.com/web/catalog/sense_power/FM142/CL1854/SC1575/PF63225
but fuck that, way too many external parts...
